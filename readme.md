# Avail

Availability functions for devices and combinators to build up fault trees.

## Definitions

A _reliability function_ reports the probability of a component or
system surviving for an additional duration "dt", called the mission
time.  It is the complement of the _failure function_, which defines
the probability of a failure before the mission is complete.

This library uses numeric evaluation of failure and reliability
functions. That is, given the input parameters, each function is
computed (and occasionally integrated) over the time of interest.
